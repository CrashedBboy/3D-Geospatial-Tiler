# 3D Geospatial Tiler
Developed a Node.js and Python-based tool using the [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) Python API to convert 3D models (OBJ or glTF) into [OGC](https://www.ogc.org/) [3D Tiles format](https://www.ogc.org/standard/3dtiles/), processing large geospatial models into tiles with varying levels of detail by analyzing mesh complexity.
